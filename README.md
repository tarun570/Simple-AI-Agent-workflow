# Ai Agents (ReAct, tool use, planning)-
                                    AI Agents are advanced systems that use Large Language Models to think, decide, and take actions. They follow methods like ReAct, which combines reasoning and actions step-by-step. They also use tools such as search, APIs, or calculators to get real data. With planning, agents break a big task into smaller steps and complete them automatically, helping users solve complex problems efficiently.

      Ex. Schedule trigger node, Form submission trigger.
2.Processing chain (middle) : processing start from here . What we can do: Data  Transformation  nodes, logic & condition nodes, API calls, validation 7 filtering etc.
