# Ai Agents (ReAct, tool use, planning)-
                                    AI Agents are advanced systems that use Large Language Models to think, decide, and take actions. They follow methods like ReAct, which combines reasoning and actions step-by-step. They also use tools such as search, APIs, or calculators to get real data. With planning, agents break a big task into smaller steps and complete them automatically, helping users solve complex problems efficiently.


# Framework n8n-
               n8n is a no-code automation framework that connects apps, APIs, and tools to automate tasks. Using drag-and-drop nodes, you can build workflows for Gmail, Google Sheets, webhooks, AI actions, and data processing—all without writing any code.

# What is work flow create Ai agent –


# 1.Entry point (start):
                                                         Every work flow start with a trigger node. Ex. Schedule trigger node, Form submission trigger.
# 2.Processing chain (middle) : 
                             processing start from here . What we can do: Data  Transformation  nodes, logic & condition nodes, API calls, validation 7 filtering etc.
# 3.End point (Exit): 
                    Final actions happen here like sending an email, saving data, notifying etc.

# How you implemented it – 

# First step- 
            Here I am use of chat box.
# Second step- 
              Here I am use of Ai agent(ReAct , Tools, Planning) . AI Agents are advanced systems that use Large Language Models to think, decide, and take actions.
# Third Step-
             Here I am use open AI (API) Model. It is a work of search valuable answer give me.
# Forth step – 
            Here I am use one simple memory tool . it’s like work previous data and you can easily get. 
# Fifth step—
            Here I am use google sheet tool.  Here student information and how to get information . I will see.
# Key challenges—
               When I am use google sheet so not easily work here I am faced very most important key challenge. How to get data from google sheets. than I will for setting and add google sheet access . than it is easily work.  Than I will go to chat box and  I give one prompt . than I am getting data easily.
